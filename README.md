# ADAS
## Simple ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance System)  
This Project simply simulates an ADAS, applying a range of automotive embedded system concepts. 
## Main Components of ADAS
Cruise Control System (CCS)
Brake Assist Control System (BACS) 
Speed Limit Control System (SLCS)
Driver Monitoring System 
## MCU 
AVR ATmega32 
## Perepherals 
80 characters LCD (4X20) with backlight\n 
4X4 Matrix Keypad Unit\n 
10 Bit Resolution ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)\n 
External INterrupt Channel\n 
Timer Module 
Internal EEPROM
## FEATURES
4 LCD Screens with swipping feature between them 
Extra Warning Screen for Drive Monitoring System 
Ability to monitor, increase and decrease speed limit for SLCS (speed limit control system) 
Monitor and control current automobile through potentiometer simulating the gas pedal motion from 0 to 200 KM/H 
KM counter, Date and Time display saved/loaded to/from internal MCU EEPROM to prevent data loss
Alarm if the current speed excedded the speed limit
